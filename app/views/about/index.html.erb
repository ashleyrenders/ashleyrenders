  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span> I'll help you navigate the circus that is freelance journalism.<br><br>The media industry has never been more tumultuous. If you're a staff writer it's scary stuff. But as a freelancer, there has never been a better time have to jump in and try new things.<br><br>That's exactly what I've been doing for the past few years.<br><br>I moved to Toronto 5 years ago, a brokenhearted mess. I had been in living in Berlin, partying, talking about my "projects" and never actually doing anything.<br><br>I had just ended a terrible relationship in the messiest and most expensive way (I won't go into the details, but it involved me spending 24 hours in Australia).<br><br><span class="strong">By the time I realized journalism was my dream job, j-school was out of the question.</span><br><br>I already had a master's degree, so going back to school felt like a huge step backwards.<br><br>While Googling "how to be a freelance journalist," I came across a program at the University of Toronto that was doing just that.<br><br>They taught me how to find my own stories and sell them to editors. They taught me to hustle. And they taught me to see my freelance career like any any other small business.<br><br>I was shocked to learn that most journalism programs don't teach ANY of this, but that's beside the point.<br><br><span class="strong">Within three months I was being published in one of Canada's biggest newspapers, <span class ="italic">National Post.</span></span><br><br>That one big success propelled me into a new phase of my life.<br><br>Since then, I've been travelling, writing and producing content like a crazy person (you can check out my full portfolio <a href="https://ashleyrenders.contently.com/" target="_blank" class="link-in-body">here</a>).<br><br>My most recent job, before I started this company, was associate producer for <a href="http://en.daily.vice.com/" target="_blank" class="link-in-body"> Daily VICE</a> in Toronto.<br><br>Some days were not the best.<br><%= image_tag 'trailmix.png' %><br><br>But most of them were really fun.<br><%= image_tag 'icecream.png' %><br><br>I produced hundreds of segments and ate a lot of cake.<br><%= image_tag '100episodes.png' %> <br><br>Before that, I was the assistant editor of a magazine called <span class="italic">Corporate Knights.</span><br><%= image_tag 'editingCK.png' %><br><br>And before that, I freelanced for Thomson Reuters in New York City and <span class="italic">National Post</span> in Toronto.<br><%= image_tag 'thomsonreuters.png' %><br><br>I've covered climate protests around the world.<br><%= image_tag 'NYCprotest.png' %><br><br>And I've made a few cameo appearances on camera. <br><%= image_tag 'Paris1.gif' %><br><br>I've met some amazing women like Jane Goodall.<br><%= image_tag 'janegoodall.png' %><br><br>And Vandana Shiva.<br><%= image_tag 'vandanashiva.gif' %><br><br>And because I have fears and anxieties just like everyone else, I spend a lot of time like this...<br><%= image_tag 'beanbag.png' %> <br><br>I've also done lots (and lots) of copyediting work that isn't worthy of Instagram.<br><br>One big success showed me that I didn't have to settled for the desk job I was in. It sounds cheesy, but I really did learn that I could make anything happen if I worked hard enough.<br><br>Now, I want to show other people how to do the same.<br><br>If you think we would be a good fit, then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">head over here</a> to find out how we can work together.
