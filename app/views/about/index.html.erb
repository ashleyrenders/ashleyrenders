  <div class='about-text'><span class='intro'> I have been writing all my life. I love collecting the details of my life, intellectualizing about them, and fascinating about that future. That's pretty much all you'll find in my collection of journals.<br><br>It helps me understand where I have been and especially where I'm going next. In other words, it helps me to make sense of my life.</div>

    That became especially important in my twenties when things got more complicated than I ever could have imagined. I just finished university when I found out I was pregnant. I did not want to have a child. I wanted to go to grad school, travel the world, help people, and I was only 21. So I had an abortion.<br><br>Let me say this now: Having an abortion is something that thousands of women do every day [stat] and every woman reacts differently. For many women, having an abortion is a relatively easy choice that they move on from.<br><br>For someone like me who was raised super Catholic - I'm talking to go church before school every morning - with a single mom who is your biggest role model and supporter, things were messy. At the time, my mom and I were just as close as we were when I was a child. Our bond was, and still is, one of the most cherished things in my life. And I would have died before telling her I had had an abortion. It just wasn't going to happen.<br><br>Having a secret like this did crazy things to my brain. I had my first panic attack sitting in a church on Good Friday, the dark, sad night before Jesus rises from the dead in the Catholic faith. I had no idea what was happening to me, but I felt like my skin was crawling, I was shaking and I needed to throw up, but I couldn't. I felt like something terrible was happening, but I couldn't figure out what it was. Chronic anxiety became a staple of my twenties and I slowly learned its ways.<br><br>I'm telling you, secrets are not good for you.<br><br>I moved to Europe to a Masters in Conflict Studies and Human Rights because I really wanted to help people who were suffering. I graduated with honors and the success of that year propelled me into the future.<br><br>I moved to Berlin, fell in love, and started the next phase of my adult life. Less than 2 months later, I found out I was pregnant again. I barely knew the person I was dating, I was nowhere near ready to have a child, and I was in a different country. I figured out how to have an abortion without health insurance and tried all over again to put the pieces back together.<br><br>It was harder than ever to figure out what I was doing with my life. I felt immense guilt for having had not one, but two abortions, but having no vision for my future. How could I be sure I didn't want to have a child if I didn't know what I wanted from my life?<br><br>I was lost with a capital "L." My relationship turned sour real quick, but I was afraid to go home because I was such a mess. And with this massive secret hanging over my head, I felt like a huge fraud. So, I spent a year and a half miserably crying in public and wandering around the world trying to find purpose in travel, but only getting more lost. <br><br>The only constant in my life was my journal. It helped me keep track of what I was learning, and slowly, without knowing it, I was starting to put the pieces together. First, I got out of that terrible relationship and moved back to home to face the music. (If you want to hear that whole story, I suggest you sign up to my newsletter. It's pretty intense, you won't be disappointed.)<br><br>I have no doubt that I would have had a difficult time in my twenties even if I had never had those unexpected pregnancies. I'm an achiever who thrives on moving forward and I had no direction at all for how my adult life was supposed to unfold. No one warned me that it would be SO complicated and uncertain.<br><br>I focus on my abortions because they were the first times I had to make clear, intelligent decisions about my own future. I had to sit down and think really hard about how I wanted my life to unfold. I'm good at doing that, but I had no preparation for how hard it would be. I had to make a decision purely for myself and stand by it.<br><br>Every woman has these experiences. They initiate us into ï»¿real life. These experiences teach us what it means to be human and to introduce us to the richest, deepest parts of life on this planet.<br><br>Telling these stories and getting them down on paper helps to light the way as we move forward down our path. They also light the way for women who are coming up behind us, trying to figure it all out.<br><br>That's why I created this company and it's core products. I want more women to write honestly and thoughtfully about their lives and to share those stories with other women who need them. I also wanted to share everything that helped me get to where I am today.</span>
