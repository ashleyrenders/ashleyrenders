  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span><br><br>I'm a freelance journalist who has worked for some of Canada's top media companies. I don't have a journalism degree. Everything I know has been collected  from first-hand experience and intense mentoring.<br><br><span class="strong">By the time I realized journalism was my dream job, j-school was out of the question.</span><br><br>While Googling "how to be a freelance journalist," I came across a <a href="http://munkschool.utoronto.ca/journalism/" class="link-in-body" target="_blank"> program at the University of Toronto</a> that was doing just that.<br><br>My teachers taught me how to find my own stories and sell them to editors, how to hustle, and how to run my freelance career like any any other small business. They also gave me their undivided attention and advice through one-on-one coaching.<br><br>I was shocked to learn that most journalism programs don't provide ANY of this, but that's beside the point.<br><br><span class="strong">Within three months I was being published in one of Canada's biggest newspapers, <span class ="italic">National Post.</span></span><br><br>That one big success propelled me into a new phase of my life.<br><br>Since then, I've been travelling, writing and producing content like a crazy person (you can check out my full portfolio <a href="https://ashleyrenders.contently.com/" target="_blank" class="link-in-body">here</a>).<br><br>Before I started this company, I was an associate producer for <a href="http://en.daily.vice.com/" target="_blank" class="link-in-body"> Daily VICE</a> in Toronto.<br><br>Some days were not the best.<br><%= image_tag 'trailmix.png' %><br><br>But most of them were really fun.<br><%= image_tag 'icecream.png' %><br><br>I produced hundreds of segments and sometimes we were rewarded with cake.<br><%= image_tag '100episodes.png' %> <br><br>Before that, I was the assistant editor of a magazine called <span class="italic">Corporate Knights.</span><br><%= image_tag 'editingCK.png' %><br><br>And before that, I freelanced for Thomson Reuters in New York City and <span class="italic">National Post</span> in Toronto.<br><%= image_tag 'thomsonreuters.png' %><br><br>I've covered climate protests around the world.<br><%= image_tag 'NYCprotest.png' %><br><br>And I've made a few on-camera appearances. <br><%= image_tag 'Paris1.gif' %><br><br>I've met some amazing women like Jane Goodall.<br><%= image_tag 'janegoodall.png' %><br><br>And Vandana Shiva.<br><%= image_tag 'vandanashiva.gif' %><br><br>And because I have fears and anxieties just like everyone else, I spend a lot of time like this...<br><%= image_tag 'beanbag.png' %> <br><br>I've also done lots (and lots) of copyediting work that isn't worthy of Instagram. I've edited over 1 million words for clients all over the world.<br><br><span class="strong">So what's the take away?</span><br><br>I went from desk job to published writer in a few months, and I want you to do the same.<br><br>If you think we would be a good fit, then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">head over here</a> to find out how we can work together.
