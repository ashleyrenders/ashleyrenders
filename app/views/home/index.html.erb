  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span><br><br>I'm a freelance journalist who helps other smart, driven, committed people do what I do.<br><br>I'm tired of seeing my fellow twenty-somethings struggle to create a meaninfgul life.<br><br>You know what I'm talking about. Your 30s are on the horizon, you have a degree (or two), you have a job but you're not satisfied with your work, or really anything in your life.<br><br><span class="strong">You're smart, driven, and you're a great writer.</span><br><br>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.<br><br>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. I think about how grateful I am that that time in my life is over every day.<br><br><span class="strong">I moved to Toronto when I was 24, a brokenhearted mess.</span><br><br>I had been in living in Berlin for the past 2 years, partying a lot and talking about my "projects," but never actually doing anything.<br><br>I had just ended a terrible relationship in the messiest, most expensive, and overly dramatic way (it involved me spending 24 hours in Australia).<br><br>Journalism was my dream job, but going to j-school was out of the question. I already had a master's degree and was NOT into the idea of going back to university.<br><br>My instincts were telling me journalism was one of those things I could learn through experience, not in a classroom.<br><br><span class="strong">So I decided to start BEING a journalist.</span><br><br>While I was researching how to get started, I came across a program at the University of Toronto that was teaching regular people how to become freelance journalists.<br><br>They taught us how to find our own stories and sell them to editors. They taught us to hustle. And they taught us to see our freelance career like any any other small business - money comes in, money goes out.<br><br><span class="strong">Things moved fast after that.</span><br><br>Within three months I was being published in <span class="italic">National Post,</span> one of Canada's biggest newspapers.<br><br>It sounds easy when I say it like that. But, it was truly terrifying, vulnerable work. I cried often and I agonized over every single word.<br><br>But then something big happened that I didn't expect:<br><br><span class="strong">I started to learn from my successes rather than my failures.</span><br><br>With some new skills I was able to start producing the work I had always dreamed of. I was seeing my name in print, on the front page of a national newspaper. After that, I was unstoppable.<br><br>Within a year, I was the assistant editor of a magazine. A year later, I was an associate producer for a daily news show at VICE Canada. Now, I'm running my own business and freelancing from places  like Mexico City and L.A.<br><br><span class="strong">I'm not saying you should quit your job to become a freelancer.</span><br><br>It's really tough out there. But that doesn't mean you should stop trying new things or learning new skills - especially when your heart is in it.<br><br> I know from experience how contagious one big success can be. So, I've made it my mission to teach other twenty-somethings the basic, teachable skills that I learned to become a journalist.<br><br> If you're tired of making excuses and you're ready to start working really hard at something you believe in, then let's get started.<br><br>I promise it will be worth it.
