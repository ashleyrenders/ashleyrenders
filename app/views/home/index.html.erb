  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span> I'm a freelance journalist who coaches other writers to find their passion, do their best work, and get published.<br><br>Tell me if this is something you can relate to: you have expertise in a fascinating field, but you're stuck in a job that you hate. Or maybe you like your job, but you're feeling deprived of creativity.<br><br><span class="strong">You're smart, driven, and you're a great writer.</span><br><br>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.<br><br>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. Those days are still very fresh in my memory.<br><br><span class="strong">But here's something I know to be true: you learn more from success than failure.</span><br><br>Success gives you the ammunition to see past the status quo. It shows you what you're doing right so you can do it again. That's how small repeated successes change your life.<br><br>If you're dreaming of becoming a successful writer or journalist, then you need to experience that rush of success as soon as possible.<br><br>Imagine seeing your story on the front page of a national newspaper, or freelancing from places like Paris, Mexico City or L.A. Or maybe you want to know what it feels like to work yourself to the bone on a project you really believe in.<br><br>It's possible, and I can show you how.<br><br><span class="strong">Yes, freelancing is tough.</span><br><br>But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, especially if your heart is in it. Journalism gives you an excuse to engage fully with the world, travel anywhere and talk to anyone. What more do you really need?<br><br>If you're tired of making excuses and you're ready to work really hard on something you're proud of then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">head over here</a> to see how we can work together.
