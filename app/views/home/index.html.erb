  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span> I'm a freelance journalist who coaches other writers to find their passion, do their work, and get published.<br><br>I'm tired of seeing my fellow twenty-somethings struggle to create a meaninfgul life.<br><br>You know what I'm talking about: Your 30s are on the horizon, you have a degree (or two), you have a job but you're not satisfied with your work, or really anything in your life.<br><br><span class="strong">You're smart, driven, and you're a great writer.</span><br><br>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.<br><br>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. I think about it all the time because it's still fresh in my memory.<br><br><span class="strong">I moved to Toronto 5 years ago, a brokenhearted mess.</span><br><br>I had been in living in Berlin for a while, partying, talking about my "projects" and never actually doing anything.<br><br>I had just ended a terrible relationship in the messiest and most expensive way (I won't go into the details, but it involved me spending 24 hours in Australia).<br><br><span class="strong">By the time I realized journalism was my dream job, j-school was out of the question.</span><br><br>I already had a master's degree, so going back to school felt like a huge step backwards.<br><br>Plus, my instincts were telling me that I needed to learn how to be a journalist in the real world, not in a classroom.<br><br><span class="strong">So I decided to start BEING a journalist.</span><br><br>While I was researching how to get started, I came across a program at the University of Toronto that was teaching regular people how to become freelance journalists.<br><br>They taught us how to find our own stories and sell them to editors. They taught us to hustle. And they taught us to see our freelance career like any any other small business - money comes in, money goes out.<br><br>I was shocked to learn that most journalism programs don't teach ANY of this.<br><br><span class="strong">Things moved fast after that.</span><br><br>Within three months I was being published regularly in the <span class="italic">National Post,</span> one of Canada's biggest newspapers.<br><br>It sounds easy on paper, but it was a terrifying, vulnerable experience. I cried often and I agonized over my work.<br><br>But after a while, a new pattern started to emerge that changed my life.<br><br><span class="strong">I started to learn from my successes rather than my failures.</span><br><br>With these new skills I was able to start producing the work I had always dreamed of. I was seeing my name in print, on the front page of a national newspaper. After that, I was kind of unstoppable.<br><br>Within a year, I was the assistant editor of a magazine. A year later, I was an associate producer for a daily news show at VICE Canada. Now, I'm running my own business and freelancing from places  like Mexico City and L.A.<br><br><span class="strong">I'm not saying you should quit your job to become a freelancer.</span><br><br>It's really tough out there. But if I had listened to that advice, I would still be working my desk job.<br><br>Just because something is hard doesnt mean you should stop learning new skills, especially when your heart is in it.<br><br> I know from experience how contagious one big success can be. So, I've made it my mission to teach other twenty-somethings the basic, teachable skills that I learned to become a journalist.<br><br> If you're tired of making excuses and you're ready to start working really hard at something you believe in, then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">let's get started</a>.<br><br>I promise it will be worth it.
