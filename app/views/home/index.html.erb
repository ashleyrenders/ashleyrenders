  <p><span class="strong">Welcome! I'm Ashley Renders.</span><br><br>I'm a freelance journalist who tries to get other smart, driven, committed people to do what I do.<br><br>I apologize in advance if you hate assumptions because I'm about to make a few about you.<br><br>I'm guessing you can see your 30s on the horizon, you have a degree (or two), and you have a job but you're not satisfied with your work, or really anything in your life.<br><br><span class="strong">You're smart, you're driven, you're a great writer.</span><br><br>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.<br><br>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. I think about it all the time because it was the scariest time in my life.<br><br><span class="strong">I moved to Toronto when I was 24, a brokenhearted mess.</span><br><br>I had been in living in Berlin for the past 2 years, partying a lot and talking about my "projects," but never actually doing anything.<br><br>I had just ended a terrible relationship in the messiest, most expensive, and overly dramatic way (it involved me spending 24 hours in Australia).<br><br>Journalism was my dream job, but going to j-school was out of the question. I already had a master's degree and was NOT into the idea of going back to university.<br><br>My instincts were telling me journalism was one of those things I needed to learn through experience, not in a classroom.</span><br><br>While I was researching ways to start being a journalist, I came across a program at the University of Toronto that was teaching regular people how to become freelance journalists.<br><br>They taught us how to find our own stories and sell them to editors. They taught us to hustle. And they taught us to see our freelance career like any any other small business - money comes in, money goes out.<br><br><span class="strong">Things moved fast after that.</span><br><br>Within three months I was being published in <span class="italic">National Post</span> one of Canada's biggest newspapers.<br><br>It sounds when I say it like that. But, it was truly terrifying, vulnerable work. I cried often and I agonized over every single word. I had zero confidence that I wasn't going to mess it up.<br><br>But then something weird happened that I didn't expect:<br><br><span class="strong">I started to learn from my successes rather than my failures.</span><br><br>Within a year, I was the assistant editor of a magazine. A year later, I was an associate producer for a daily news show at VICE Canada. Now, I'm running my own business and freelancing from places  like Mexico City and L.A.<br><br><span class="strong">I'm not saying you should quit your job to become a freelancer.</span><br><br>It's really tough out there. But that doesn't mean you should keep doing what you're doing blindly, or stop trying new things - especially when your heart is in it.<br><br> I know from experience how contagious one big success can be.<br><br> So, I've made it my mission to teach other twenty-somethings the basic, teachable skills that I learned to become a journalist.<br><br> If you're tired of making excuses and you're ready to start working really hard at something you believe in, then let's get started.<br><br>I promise it will be worth it.
