  <p><span class="strong">Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</span> I'm a freelance journalist who coaches other writers to find their passion, do their best work, and get published.<br><br>I'm tired of seeing my fellow twenty-somethings struggle to create a meaninfgul life.<br><br>You know what I'm talking about: Your 30s are on the horizon, you have a degree (or two), you have a job but you're not satisfied with your work, or really anything in your life.<br><br><span class="strong">You're smart, driven, and you're a great writer.</span><br><br>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.<br><br>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. Those days are still very fresh in my memory.<br><br><span class="strong">Here's something I know to be true: you learn more from success than failure.</span><br><br>Failure can destroy your hope for a better future. It can it seem like your effort is worthless, so you might as well make the best of what you have now.<br><br>All it takes is one big success to break you out of that cycle.<br><br>Getting published can be that thing.<br><br>Imagine seeing your story on the front page of a national newspaper. Imagine freelancing from places like Paris, Mexico City or L.A. Imagine working yourself to the bone on a project that you believe in.<br><br> <span class="strong">Yes, freelancing is tough.</span><br><br>But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. Journalism is an excuse to engage fully with the world, to ask questions, and do see purpose in everything.<br><br>I want you to know what that feels like. So, I've made it my mission to teach other twenty-somethings the basic, teachable skills that I learned to become a journalist.<br><br> If you're tired of making excuses and you're ready to start working really hard at something you believe in, then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">let's get started</a>.<br><br>I promise it will be worth it.
