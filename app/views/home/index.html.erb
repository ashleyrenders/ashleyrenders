    <h2>Hey, I'm Ashley Renders.</h2>
    <p>I'm a freelance journalist who coaches other writers to find their passion, do their best work, and get published.</p>
    <p>I work with writers who either didn't learn how to pitch in journalism school or don't want to go to journalism school at all.</p>
    <p>I give my clients intensive one-on-one coaching and editing until their pitch is accepted and they've negotiated payment.</p>
    <p>Tell me if this is something you can relate to: you have expertise in a fascinating field, but you're stuck in a job that you hate. Or maybe you like your job, but you're feeling deprived of creativity.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">You're smart, driven, and you're a great writer.</span></p>
    <p>But you haven't created anything you're proud of since university and you're wondering how you got to this point. You thought you would be making a name for yourself by now.</p>
    <p>I remember what it felt like to be lost, confused, and desperate to do something bigger. Those days are still fresh in my memory.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">But here's something I know to be true: you learn more from success than failure.</p></span>
    <p>Success gives you ammunition to see past the status quo. It shows you what you're doing right so you can do it again. That's how small repeated successes change your life.</p>
    <p>If you're dreaming of becoming a successful writer or journalist, then you need to experience that rush of success as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Imagine seeing your story on the front page of a national newspaper, or freelancing from places like Paris, Mexico City or L.A. Or maybe you want to know what it feels like to work yourself to the bone on a project you really believe in.</p>
    <p>It's possible, and I can show you how.</p><br>
    <h2>Why hire a mentor?</h2>
    <p>We hire "mentors" to help us buy homes.</p>
    <p>We hire "mentors" to get our bodies into shape and meet fitness goals.
    <p>We hire "mentors" when we need help getting into college.
    <p>I hired a team of mentors through the Munk School of Global Affairs, and now I'm a freelance journalist with my own business.</p>
    <p>Most of us have paid a mentor to help us find success and happiness with our creative dreams.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it's really hard to find mentorship in the journalism industry, especially if you're just starting out. You need the undivided attention of someone who is willing to show you the ropes, coach you with patience, and hold you to your promises.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">That's the kind of attention I give to my all of clients, which is why I only work with 5 people at a time.</span></p>
    <p><span class="strong italic">If you're ready to see your name in print then <a href="<%= work_with_me_index_path %>" class="link-in-body">head over here</a> to find out how we can work together.</span></p>

          I wasn't exactly sure what I was looking to get out of my conversation with Ashley about breaking into freelance writing and getting published, but I really liked her vibes when we chatted over e-mail. So I followed my gut and we set a date to meet in person -- and I'm super glad we did! I'd hit a slump, and had been feeling like my marketing work was sapping my creative energy and desire to pursue writing that actually made me happy (and not just writing that paid the bills).
        </p>
        <p>
          My conversation with Ashley re-invigorated me. She gave me helpful insights into the freelance world, great tips and resources for how to craft a killer pitch, and even the names of specific publications and editors that she's enjoyed working with.
        </p>
        <p>
          So even if you're a total newbie to the freelance world or are feeling (like I was) scared/intimidated about trying to break into said freelance world... just bite the bullet and get in touch with Ashley. Her enthusiasm is infectious and she earnestly believes that everyone has a story worth telling, which is a pretty empowering feeling to walk away with.

          The reason most would-be freelance writers fail is simple: they never take action. They dream, but they never send a pitch. They research, but they never follow through. Getting started as a freelance writer is a daunting challenge full of uncertainty, overwhelming complexity and lots of fear. Ashley Renders helps new writers cut through all the obstacles and jump into action. Her newsletter helps would-be writers become working writers. Ashley only works one-on-one with a small number of writers at a time, but for those who don't have the good fortune to have her personal guidance, her newsletter is the next best thing. The best thing would-be writers can do to ensure their success is to enlist the help of a mentor on their journey. Ashley helps writers make the big leap and land with a flourish!
