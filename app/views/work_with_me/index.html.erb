     <br><br>I'm so excited that you want to start BEING a journalist. Not learning about being a journalist, not thinking about being a journalist - BEING A JOURNALIST.<br><br>Smart, driven, future-focused people are my favourite types of people to work with, so I can't wait to meet you.<br><br><br><br><span class="title">There are a couple of ways we can work together.</span><br><br><span class="georgia">1. Download my free pitching guide.</span><br><br>If you've been pitching your stories for a while, but have't had any luck, then I suggest you start by downloading my free pitching guide. It will help you eliminate all that trial and error work you've been doing so you can focus on writing like the pro that you are.<br><br>You can do that right here.<%= render 'shared/ckworkwithmeoptin' %><br><br><span class="georgia">2. Send me your pitch</span><br><br>If you're still not getting the results you're looking for, send your pitch over to me and I'll give it a solid edit. You're probably making simple mistakes that I can point out so you never make them again.<br><br>I charge a cool $25 per pitch.<br><br><br><br><span class="georgia">3. Hire me as your coach</span><br><br>If you:<br><br>- Are just starting out<br>- Have no idea what makes a good story<br>- Have never written a pitch before<br>- Haven't talked to an editor before<br>- Are completely frozen in fear<br><br>Then my coaching services can do so much for you. So, so much.<br><br>I'll take you by the hand over the next 3 months and guide you through the entire process of finding a good story, pitching it, and negotiating payment.<br><br>It's a 3-month commitment because that's how long it takes to learn the ropes and get a solid pitch out the door and approved.<br><br>We will meet twice a month for 1 hour. We'll start by talking about your ideas and figure out which one will make a killer story that editors will eat up.<br><br>Then, we'll come up with a plan to pitch that story and deliver it.<br><br><br><br><span class="title">This is a commitment that you're making to yourself</span><br><br>You're committing to getting this work done because it's important to you. And I'm going to hold you to it.<br><br>We'll come up with a schedule and you'll submit your work to me on time, just like you would with an editor. You'll learn what it feels like to say, "Sorry, I can't. I'm on a deadline."<br><br>It will feel terrifying and amazing.<br><br>I'll also edit your work thoroughly, point out spelling and grammar mistakes and coach you on your writing style.<br><br>I'll answer all of your questions about how to talk to editors, negotiate payment and find sources.<br><br>You'll get a mentor, coach and editor rolled up into one new best friend who really really wants you to succeed.<br><br><br><br><span class="title">At the end of our time together, you will have:</span><br><br>- A very clear understanding of how to write a successful pitch.<br><br>- Feedback on your specific writing style.<br><br>- Scripts for how to talk to editors.<br><br>- A schedule that fits your life and leads you to achieve your writing goals.<br><br>- The confidence to pitch and write stories as a freelancer.<br><br>-A big win that you can use to propel you into a new phase in your life.<br><br><br><br>If you're interested in working with me one-on-one, I would love to hear from you!
