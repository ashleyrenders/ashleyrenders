     <br><br>I'm so excited that you want to start being a journalist. Not learning about being a journalist, not thinking about being a journalist - BEING a journalist.<br><br>Smart, future-focused people are my favourite types of people to work with. I can't wait to meet you!<br><br><br><span class="strong">Here are three ways we can work together.</span><br><br><span class="title">1. Download my free pitching guide.</span><br><br>If you've been pitching your stories for a while, but have't had any luck, then I suggest you start by downloading my free pitching guide. It will help you eliminate all that trial and error work you've been doing so you can focus on writing like the pro that you are.<br><br>You can do that right here.<%= render 'shared/ckworkwithmeoptin' %><span class="title">2. Send me your pitch</span><br><br>If you're still not getting the results you're looking for, send me your pitch and I'll give it a solid edit. You're probably making simple mistakes that I can point out so you never make them again. A one-time edit can solve so many problems.<br><br>I charge a cool $39 per pitch.<br><br><br><br><span class="title">3. Hire me as your coach</span><br><br>If you:<br><br>- Are just starting out<br>- Have no idea what makes a good story<br>- Have never written a pitch before<br>- Haven't talked to an editor before<br>- Are completely frozen in fear<br><br>Then I suggest we work together one-on-one.<br><br>I'll take you by the hand over the next 3 months and guide you through the process of finding a good story, pitching it, and negotiating payment.<br><br>It's a 3-month commitment because that's how long it takes to learn the ropes and get a solid pitch out the door and approved.<br><br>We'll meet twice a month for 1 hour each time. We'll start by talking about your ideas and figure out which one will make a killer story that an editor will snap up.<br><br>Then, we'll come up with a plan to pitch that story and deliver it.<br><br>I'll edit your work thoroughly, point out spelling and grammar mistakes and coach you on your writing style.<br><br>I'll be at your disposal to answer questions about how to talk to editors, negotiate payment and find sources.<br><br>You'll get a mentor, coach and editor rolled up into one new best friend who really really wants you to succeed.<br><br><br><br><span class="strong">This is a commitment you're making to yourself</span><br><br>None of this will work unless you do. By signing on to work with me, you're committing to getting this work done because it's important to you.<br><br>I'm going to hold you to deadlines.<br><br>We'll come up with a schedule and you'll submit your work to me on time, just like you would with an editor. You'll learn what it feels like to say, "Sorry, I can't. I'm on a deadline."<br><br>It will feel terrifying and amazing.<br><br><br><br><span class="strong">At the end of our time together, you will have:</span><br><br>- A very clear understanding of how to write a successful pitch.<br><br>- Feedback on your specific writing style.<br><br>- Scripts for talking to editors.<br><br>- A schedule that fits your life and leads you to achieve your writing goals.<br><br>- The confidence to pitch and write stories as a freelancer.<br><br>-A big win that you can use to propel you into a new phase in your life.<br><br><br><br><span class="strong">I won't abandon you.</span><br><br>If you need help writing the article that you've successfully pitched, you can keep me on your team until you're ready to do it on your own.<br><br>If you're interested in working with me, I would love to hear from you! Enter you email below and I'll be in touch within 24 hours.<%= render 'shared/ckworkwithmecontact' %><span class="italic">**If one-on-one work feels right for you, please don't hesitate to get in touch because I can only work with 5 clients at a time. I really want to see your name on my calendar, so make sure you add your name to the list.</span>
