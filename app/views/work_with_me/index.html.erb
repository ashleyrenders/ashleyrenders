    <p><br><br>I'm so excited that you want to start being a journalist. Not learning about being a journalist, not thinking about being a journalist - BEING a journalist.</p>
    <p>You have everything it takes to get published. You just need to show up, do the work, and learn some best practices.</p>
    <h2><br>Here's how we can work together.<h2>
    <h3>1. Download my free pitching guide.</h3>
    <p>If you've been pitching your stories for a while, but have't had any luck, then I suggest you start by downloading my free pitching guide. It will help you eliminate all that trial and error work you've been doing so you can focus on writing like the pro that you are.</p>
    <span class="ck-optin"><%= render 'shared/ckworkwithmeoptin' %></span>
    <p>You can do that right here. --> </p>
    <h3>2. Send me your pitch</h3>
    <p>If you're still not getting the results you're looking for, send me your pitch and I'll give it a solid edit. You're probably making simple mistakes that I can point out so you never make them again. A one-time edit can solve so many problems.</p>
    <p>I charge a cool $39 per pitch.</p>
    <h3>3. Hire me as your coach</h3>
    <p>If you:</p>
    <p>- Are just starting out<br>- Have no idea what makes a good story<br>- Have never written a pitch before<br>- Haven't talked to an editor before<br>- Are completely frozen in fear</p>
    <p>Then I suggest we work together one-on-one.</p>
    <p>I'll take you by the hand over the next 3 months and guide you through the process of finding a good story, pitching it, and negotiating payment.</p>
    <p>It's a 3-month commitment because that's how long it takes to learn the ropes and get a solid pitch out the door and approved.<br><br></p>
    <p><span class="strong">Here's what you'll get:</span></p>
    <p>- We'll meet twice a month for 1 hour. We'll start by talking about your ideas. Then we'll figure out which one will make a killer story that an editor will snap up.</p>
    <p>- Next, I'll coach you through the process of writing a pitch and sending it to editors. We'll continue to meet twice a month to talk about the responses you get from editors, and how to follow up when you haven't heard back.</p>
    <p>- I'll edit your work thoroughly, point out spelling and grammar mistakes, ask you to back up facts, and coach you on your writing style.</p>
    <p>- I'll be at your disposal to answer questions about how to talk to editors, negotiate payment and find sources.</p>
    <p>Think of me an experienced friend who really really wants you succeed.</p>

    <p><span class="strong">This is a commitment you're making to yourself</span></p>
    <p>None of this will work unless you do. By signing on to work with me, you're committing to getting this work done because it's important to you.</p>
    <p>We'll come up with a schedule and you'll submit your work to me on time, just like you would with an editor. You'll learn what it feels like to say, "Sorry, I can't. I'm on a deadline."</p>
    <p>It will feel terrifying and amazing.</p>
    <p><br><br><span class="strong">At the end of our time together, you will have:</span></p>
    <p>- A very clear understanding of how to write a successful pitch.</p>
    <p>- Feedback on your specific writing style.</p>
    <p>- Scripts for talking to editors.</p>
    <p>- A writing schedule that fits your life and leads you to achieve your goals.</p>
    <p>-A big win that you can use to propel you into a new phase in your life.</p>
    <p><br><br>
    <span class="strong">Don't worry, I won't abandon you.</span></p>
    <p>If you need help writing the article that you've successfully pitched, you can keep me on your team until you're ready to do it on your own (but we can talk about that later).</p>
    <p>If you're interested in working with me, I would love to hear from you! Enter you email below and I'll be in touch within 24 hours.<br><br>
    <span class="italic">**If one-on-one work feels right for you, please don't hesitate to get in touch because I can only work with 5 clients at a time. I really want to see your name on my calendar, so make sure you add your name to the list.</span>
