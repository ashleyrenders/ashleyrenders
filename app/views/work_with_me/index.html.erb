    <p><span class='strong'>I'm so excited that you want to start being a journalist.</span> Not learning about being a journalist, not thinking about being a journalist - BEING a journalist.</p>
    <p>You have everything it takes to get published. You just need to show up, do the work, and learn some best practices.</p>
    <h2><br>Here's how we can work together.<h2>
    <h3>1. Send me your pitch</h3>
    <p>If you're ready to throw your laptop out the window because no one is repsonding to your pitches, I can help. I'll point out the mistakes you're making so you never do them again.</p>
    <h3>Here's what will happen:</h3>
    <p>- You'll send me your pitch in a Word document and I'll edit the heck out of it with Tracked Changes.</p>
    <p>- I'll makes comments in the document with tips on how to improve your pitch, questions about your facts, and any other red flags I come across.<p>
    <p>- I'll email two documents back to you: a tracked version with all of my changes visible and a clean version that you can send to the editor of choice.</p>
    <p>- A personalized email with feedback on your writing style and comments about your story idea.</p>
    <p>A one-time edit can do wonders for your pitching game. If that's what you need, skip to the bottom of this page to enter your email. I'll be in touch within 24 hours.</p>
    <h3>2. Hire me as your coach</h3>
    <p>If you:</p>
    <p>- Are just starting out</p>
    <p>- Have no idea what makes a good story</p>
    <p>- Have never written a pitch before</p>
    <p>- Haven't talked to an editor before</p>
    <p>- Are completely frozen in fear</p>
    <p>- Haven't experienced success as a writer</p>
    <p>I'll take you by the hand over the next 3 months and guide you through the process of finding a good story, pitching it, and negotiating payment.</p>
    <p>It's a 3-month commitment because that's how long it takes to learn the ropes and get a solid pitch out the door and approved.<br><br></p>
    <h3>Here's what you'll get:</h3>
    <p>- We'll meet twice a month for 1 hour on the phone, over Skype or in person. We'll start by talking about your ideas. Then we'll choose one to turn into a pitch that editors will snap up.</p>
    <p>- Next, I'll coach you through the process of writing a pitch and sending it to editors. We'll continue to meet twice a month to talk about the responses you get from editors, and how to follow up when you haven't heard back.</p>
    <p>- I'll edit your work thoroughly, point out spelling and grammar mistakes, ask you to back up facts, and coach you on your writing style.</p>
    <p>- I'll be at your disposal to answer questions about how to talk to editors, negotiate payment and find the right sources.</p>
    <p>Think of me an editor and coach wrapped up in one person who really really wants you to succeed.</p>
    <h2 class='quote'>"Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.‚Äù - William Hutchison Murray</h2>
    <p><span class="strong">This is a commitment you're making to yourself</span></p>
    <p>None of this will work unless you do. By signing on to work with me, you're committing to getting this work done because it's important to you.</p>
    <p>We'll come up with a schedule and you'll submit your work to me on time, just like you would with an editor. You'll learn what it feels like to say, "Sorry, I can't. I'm on a deadline."</p>
    <p>It will feel terrifying and amazing.</p>
    <p><br><br><span class="strong">At the end of our time together, you will have:</span></p>
    <p>- A very clear understanding of how to write a successful pitch.</p>
    <p>- Feedback on your specific writing style.</p>
    <p>- Scripts for talking to editors.</p>
    <p>- A writing schedule that fits your life and leads you to achieve your goals.</p>
    <p>-A big win that you can use to propel you into a new phase in your life.</p>
    <p><br><br>
    <span class="strong">Don't worry, I won't abandon you.</span></p>
    <p>If you need help writing the article that you've successfully pitched, you can keep me on your team until you're ready to do it on your own.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in working with me, I would love to hear from you! Enter you email below and I'll be in touch within 24 hours.<br><br>
    <span class="italic">**If one-on-one work feels right for you, please don't hesitate to get in touch because I can only work with 5 clients at a time. I really want to see your name on my calendar, so make sure you add your name to the list.</span>
